And from this pattern, we get some ranges that help us to give early warnings.We are more interested in non-survivor patients’ vital signs as compare to survivor patients. we find patterns in vital signs that could better determine that patient died (ex. if Sp02 is below 70, patient in 95% of cases died, if Sp02 is below 50%, the death rate is 99.9%) or we can take correlations which can help us to find better patterns to define death cases.Data The dataset which was used for analysis here is taken from the mimic website. But the dataset is not in the correct format which we want, after some manipulation, we get the data ready for the analysis.ApproachI can’t go with 1st option because a major part of the data has missing values. so, I decided to go with the second option and fill missing values with the average of upper and lower values. But before that, I filtered the data and take only those patients’ data who died in a hospital or survive.SQLMongoDBGoogle Cloudhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mo7i32BoEVb0Ac6_CWwJd7_HVbliktx0?usp=sharingWe provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
