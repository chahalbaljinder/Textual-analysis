In addition to this different ranges of data was scrapped generated directed output for the respective tasks in the form of CSV format. So the user’s main aim requirement was achieved i.e. a non programmer could create a con-fig and initiate a bot to scrap the required data.The majority task of project consisted of web data scraping automation so a high- level overview, and specific implementation details of project shall will be as follows:None. All the structured data was in the form of either python Data Frames, CSV or Excel Sheets.Chrome driver initiatedChrome driver visiting the directed links and accessing the image URLsDirected to next linkKML taskFacebook Data extractionData of State Governments of USAccessing links through wiki directing to countiesNesting within the list of counties of a particular stateFinding and Extracting link of the website of CountyThe GitHub repository link:- https://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Paul-Andr-Savoie/tree/mainHere are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthy For project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
