The main motive was to understand the behaviour of concrete based on various parameters – Compressive strength, Flexural strength, water absorption capabilities of the concrete and many more. The analysis should include, but was not limited to:Phase 2:In this phase, we had to develop a structure for the research paper based on the results and analysis. The paper included sections – Abstract, Introduction ( literature, background and objective), Experimental program ( materials and methods), Results and discussion ( analysis and interpretation) and Conclusion ( summary, insights and remarks).Providing a Comprehensive analysis for the concrete data – showcasing the key insights from it based on the parameters (compressive strength, etc). On the basis of results from the analysis, research paper was drafted which included all the deliverable.A manuscript (drafted article) with the following:Tools used:Statistical models – linear, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic models build for showcasing behavior of concrete mixes due to mixing of different fiber content and its effect on different parameters specified above.Coding – PythonPerforming statistical analysis – extracting inferencesBuilding statistical models – through python or through Excel and its counterparts.No database was used.No Cloud server was used.The Challenges faced during project execution are:I had to use different libraries for building the models, later on turned to MS excel and spreadsheet because they were building models and were also able to showcase it on the data itself. For this, I learned how to build models on the aforementioned software through YouTube and blogs.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
