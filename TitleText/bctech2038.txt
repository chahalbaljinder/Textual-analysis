To accomplish the given task, 2 tools were developed for each website.Extracted content from all the websites was stored in their respective text files. After that number of keywords in the text were counted using substring and count method and stored the keyword and its corresponding count in an Ordered Dictionary and then the count was transferred to a list and Excel file was created for the same. Counts received from search tool and content tool were combined and final output file was created.Python InterpreterLanguage Used: PythonLibraries used: BeautifulSoup, collection.OrderedDict, pandas, requests, xlsxwriter, selenium.webdriverSome of the websites cannot be accessed using Indian IP address as it was having captchas. Also, we cannot go to each and every page by clicking the results and get the count.To bypass the captcha and reach the website, we need to use VPN of Singapore. And to get access to each and every page of the website, we found out sitemap for each website which includes link to every page present in it.Here are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthy For project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
