The dataset contained Short durations as well as Long durations. Build models for each set of durations, compare and get the best out of all.Here, we had to predict the traffic incident duration with some machine learning tools and techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR and Deep Learning algorithm using tensor flow. First two models were run on Python Interpreter whereas Deep learning model was run on R studio, all the three with the same dataset and then we had compared these models based on their MAE (mean absolute error). Initially, we had done a preliminary analysis of the collected incident duration data, to collect the statistical characteristics of all the variables used in our research.Python InterpreterLanguage Used: PythonLibraries Used: pandas, sklearn, numpy, keras, pickleProgramming, Statistical AnalysisWe provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
