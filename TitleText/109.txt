We have found the co-relation between the tempa msa pitchbook data and the output files like textual file, ai_ml_tm file etc. We have made the dashboard using the Google Data Studio.We have provided a excel file consisting of clean data and the Google Data Studio report.Python, Google Data Studio, Google ChromePython Programming Waterfall model used in this project.Data cleaning, Data Pre-processing, Data Visualisation are used in this project.We have used the traditional file systems as database storage.Cleaning the data was the major challenge faced while executing the project. The data has a lot of noise. It was difficult to find which data was useful and which data is not useful in this project. Secondly the co relation between the output files and pitchbook data. There was nothing common between both the datasets. So was difficult to find co-relation between them. We used pandas dataframe to clean the data and make it ready for predictive modelling and used the Google Data studio to find insights between the different datasets.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
