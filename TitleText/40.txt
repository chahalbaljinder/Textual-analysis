The processed data from this tool will be send to the Google big query database and our GBQ will be linked to the Google Data Studio for the insights presentation. Therefore as the data will keep on updating in the google big query accordingly the dashboard in our google data studio will gets updated.The final deliverable was the ready-to-use dashboard and website where the preprocessing of the data happens.The project was easy to implement and the architecture was simple therefore no major challenges were encountered.https://plaid-conversion.herokuapp.com/Here are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthy For project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
