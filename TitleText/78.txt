We need to use machine learning and deep learning models which have greater than 90% accuracy. We created a notebook for anomaly detection. We used 10 to 15 machine learning and deep learning models but only  3 different types of auto encoder models that were giving greater than 90% accuracy. We trained all 3 models on one classification data which have anomalies and evaluated trained models on test data.A notebook that has solutions for anomaly detection related classification problems and accuracy should be above 90%.Google colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Google drivePython programming language, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data analysis and Data visualization.Auto Encoder and Variational Auto EncoderPython, Data Analysis, Data visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning.MS ExcelWe provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
