The NER-Task should be done by using Bert (NER-GermanÂ https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-germanÂ or something similar).Â The input to this first task is a text in XML-Format. It is important that the structuring text is not altered by the NER. This could be possible by tokenizing the XML-elements in a different/seperate way, to then run the NER with BERT and afterwards add the elements afterwards at the exact position where the initially were. The tags that were added by the NER than can be easily replaced with the required tags in the XML-format.Â Input Data ðŸ¡ª XML Text Tokenization ðŸ¡ª NER Model ðŸ¡ª Replace NER Tags with XML Tags ðŸ¡ª Final OutputPython toolDocumentationInstallationÂ VSCode For Python scriptPython Programming LanguageNamed Entity Recognition (NER)Â FuzzyWuzzytqdmFlairPandasData LoadingData ProcessingData RestoringDuring the project execution, we faced the following challenges:To solve the technical challenges, we provided following solutions as follow:The client can know easily predict the Name, Place, and Organisation from XML containing file by using our python script model.Fig. Input XML fileFig. Output XML file with predicted values.Github: https://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Sven-Meier-XML-tool/tree/masterHere are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyÂ For project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
