First was the ingestion of existing data into the cloud-based CRM platform.2. Second was the question of automating the process of adding newer records to the cloud platform. The client has been provided with python scripting handling bulk data ingestion to CRM and also the script to handle daily synchronization of data.– Python– MySQL Database– Postman– TeamViewer– Automation– 3rd party APIs– Authentication methods– Multi-Threading of function calls– bat Scripts for easier running of scripts for the clientPython Frameworks like requests to build own custom client for consumption of APIs.Python Programming, Mult-threading, APIs The client provided a MySQL instance.Zoho – Writing own client-side API-consumption code handling API calls from Authentication and Other Operations as per task requirements.– Debugging of API responses was messy.– Multiple alternatives were discussed and implemented in python like conditional refreshing of API tokens.– Automation of daily synchronization handled by use of time deltas.– Logging of all operations to efficiently handle errors in the future.– Automated workflow of the client– No need for dull tasks like data entry to CRM modules everything is taken care of using logic.https://www.exportgenius.in/We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
