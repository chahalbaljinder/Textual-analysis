In addition to this, all of the backend javascript also needed to be changed in order to query the new elasticsearch database.The client’s website was a visualization tool. It also had GUI to add filters. To make the visualizations, at least 50,000 records needed to be pulled from the Postgres database whose size would be around 200mbs. This would take a lot of time (nearly 20-30 secs). Adding filters would take additional time. So our task was to move the entire database over to Elasticsearch from postgres since it is way more faster in search operations and also filtering data. Since the database was changed, we also had to write new backend code that would now query the Elasticsearch database.ElasticsearchPostmanKibanaLogstashPythonJavascriptAmazon Web ServicesPostgresDockerGit BucketGithubJavascriptJsonDomain-Specific Language for elasticsearchbashElasticsearch query knowledgePostgres query knowledgeNetworkingJavascriptBackend web stackPostgresElasticsearchAmazon Web Services (AWS)To solve the above mentioned problem, we used gzip in the request url’s header. This significantly reduced the execution times.Earlier postgres infrastructure which took around 20-30 secs now too consistently less than 10 secs to perform filter and search operations. This would contribute to a better user experience.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
