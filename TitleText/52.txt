When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details.After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month.  We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user’s call records. For recent dates we used python’s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time.2 python scriptsVS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel.Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime.Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematicslocal data from MS Excel SheetHere are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthy For project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
