He wanted to see all his client appointments at one place. Client took subscription of Monday.com. It is an CRM where you can manage your work more easily in neat and clean user-friendly environment. We can easily track our task on Monday.com. Pipeline for Monday.com is very easy to use and also customized according to our needs.The challenging part of this project was to get CRM data on Monday.com dashboard. Client also has subscription of Zapier. Zapier is a connector which connect two apps to transfer data from each other. Zapier also has limitation to fetch limited type of data from CRM. Like for Mohsin CRM we can only fetch hot lead comes on CRM. But in his CRM there are also other functions like if a customer lead comes on CRM. They manually book appointment for that client. So there is no way to get that data from CRM. Issue for client was he has attached integrated four google calendar account with CRM so whenever he confirms appointment on CRM that data fetched on google calendar. But he has check manually one by one on each calendar which was bit hard task for him. So, we advised Monday.com where he can track all his task at one place.The challenging part of this project was to get CRM data on Monday.com dashboard.There is no direct integration of CRM and Monday.com to fetch data.To solve challenges, we used Zapier to get CRM data to dashboard of Monday.com.
