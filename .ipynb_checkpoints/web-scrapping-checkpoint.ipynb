       " \"Politically, by the rd century BCE, the kingdom ofMagadhahad annexed or reduced other states to emerge as theMauryan Empire.The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as forAshoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhistdhamma.TheSangam literatureof theTamil languagereveals that, between BCEand CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by theCheras, theCholas, and thePandyas, dynasties thattraded extensively with the Roman Empireand withWestandSoutheast Asia.In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.By the th and th centuries, theGupta Empirehad created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.This renewal was reflected in a flowering ofsculptureandarchitecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.Classical Sanskrit literatureflowered as well, andIndian science,astronomy,medicine, andmathematicsmade significant advances.Medieval IndiaBrihadeshwara temple,Thanjavur, completed in CETheQutub Minar, \\xa0m (\\xa0ft) tall, completed by theSultan of Delhi,IltutmishThe Indian early medieval age, from  to CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.WhenHarshaofKannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from  to CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by theChalukyaruler of the Deccan.When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by thePalaking ofBengal.When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by thePallavasfrom farther south, who in turn were opposed by thePandyasand theCholasfrom still farther south.No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.In the th and th centuries, the firstdevotional hymnswere created in the Tamil language.They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of allmodern languages of the subcontinent.Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.By the th and th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-dayMyanmar,Thailand,Laos,Brunei,Cambodia,Vietnam,Philippines,Malaysia, andIndonesia.Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.After the th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, usingswift-horsecavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the IslamicDelhi Sultanatein .The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India.\",\n",
       " \"Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.By repeatedly repulsingMongol raidersin the th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries ofmigrationof fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenousVijayanagara Empire.Embracing a strongShaivitetradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.Early modern IndiaIn the early th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.The resultingMughal Empiredid not stamp out the local societies it came to rule.\",\n",
       " 'Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practicesand diverse and inclusive ruling elites,leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially underAkbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agricultureand mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,resulting in greater patronage ofpainting, literary forms, textiles, andarchitecture.Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as theMarathas, theRajputs, and theSikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.A distant view of theTaj Mahalfrom theAgra FortA twomohurCompany gold coin, issued in , theobverseinscribed \"William IIII, King\"By the early th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including theEnglish East India Company, had established coastal outposts.The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over theBengalregion by  and sideline the other European companies.Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the s.India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying theBritish Empirewith raw materials.',\n",
       " \"Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.Modern IndiaMain article:History of India (–present)Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between  and .\",\n",
