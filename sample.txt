Paris Olympics 2024 LIVE Updates: On the 14th day of the Paris Olympics 2024, Wrestler Aman Sehrawat on 9 August defeated Puerto Rico's Darian Toi Cruz in Men’s freestyle 57kg category to bring India's 5th bronze medal. This is also the first wrestling medal for India in the Paris Olympics 2024.

With this, India's medal tally rose to 6, including 5 bronze and one silver. 

Also, the Indian athletics campaign ended as the men's 4x400 m relay race team fell just short of reaching the medal round and finished fifth and 11th overall in the qualification round on Friday.

Among other details, the Court of Arbitration for Sports on 9 August said that the decision on Vinesh Phogat's plea against her disqualification over weight issues is expected to be issued before the end of the Olympic Games. 

Earlier on 8 August, Neeraj Chopra surpassed his gold-medal throw from Tokyo but missed out on a second consecutive top finish due to an exceptional performance by Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem. The Indian men's hockey team gave PR Sreejesh a storybook ending to his career. He retired with two consecutive Olympic medals after starting his international journey when India first failed to qualify for the Games. 

Neeraj Chopra threw 1.87m farther than his Tokyo Olympic gold-winning throw, but in Paris, he secured silver as Arshad Nadeem made history for Pakistan with an Olympic record throw of 92.97m, crossing 90m again with his final attempt to claim gold. Nadeem is the first Pakistani to win an individual Olympic gold. Neeraj becomes the third Indian, after PV Sindhu and Sushil Kumar, to win individual Olympic medals at two different Games.
