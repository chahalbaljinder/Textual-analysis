This file includes the base image, installation of dependencies, copying of Lambda function code, and setting the handler function.Docker Image:The Docker image built from the Dockerfile. This image encapsulates your Lambda function code and its dependencies.Pushed Image to ECR:The Docker image pushed to your Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. This involves tagging the image with the ECR repository URI and pushing it to the repository.Updated Lambda Function Configuration:The Lambda function configuration was updated to use the Docker image from ECR. This may involve specifying the ECR URI in the Lambda configuration.Documentation: Documentation outlining the steps to Dockerize the Lambda function and push it to ECR. This documentation should include prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and any additional considerations.Challenge: AWS Lambda imposes constraints on runtime dependencies, making it challenging to manage and control library versions.Challenge: AWS Lambda’s managed environment may lack certain runtime configurations and isolation.Challenge: Efficiently capturing and analyzing performance metrics and logs from Dockerized Lambda functions.Solution: Use a containerization approach to package dependencies along with the Lambda function, providing better control and isolation. Implement a robust dependency management system within the Docker container.Solution: Docker containers offer enhanced isolation. Utilize containers to encapsulate the Lambda function and its dependencies, ensuring consistent execution environments.Solution: Integrate AWS CloudWatch for basic monitoring. Dockerizing a Lambda Function:https://www.loom.com/share/e90438538dbb43fd884a51dab6c175e9?t=586&sid=b2e4112e-16b9-4d78-a955-77a289453e59 Summarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.This solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
